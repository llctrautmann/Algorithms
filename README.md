## Introduction

As a beginner in Python, it's crucial to practice writing code and solving problems. The Python Mini Projects in this repository are meant to provide you with opportunities to strengthen your understanding of Python syntax, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

Each mini project is contained in its own file, with a clear problem statement and instructions on what needs to be implemented. You'll find puzzles that cover a wide range of topics, including loops, conditionals, functions, data structures, and more. By working on these puzzles, you'll gain hands-on experience and gradually enhance your Python proficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Python Mini Projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
   ```
   cd Algorithms
   ```

3. Explore the collection of mini projects and choose the one you want to work on.

4. Open the selected Python file in your preferred code editor.

5. Read the problem statement and instructions carefully.

6. Implement your solution to the puzzle, keeping in mind the requirements and constraints mentioned in the file.

7. Test your code thoroughly to ensure its correctness.

8. Feel free to experiment and modify the code to further enhance your learning.

9. Once you've completed a mini project, you can move on to another one or even try optimizing your solution.

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
python-mini-projects/
  |- puzzle1.py
  |- puzzle2.py
  |- puzzle3.py
  |- ...
```

Each Python file represents a separate mini project. You can choose any puzzle that interests you, open its file, and start working on it. The decription is provided as a string in the beginning of the file.
